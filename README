3. Usage
--------

 3a. Access page types (!Proposed!)
 ---------------------

  Regular pages ("static" pages):
    http://t3cms/s/pageName

  Dynamic pages ("live" pages):
    http://t3cms/l/pageName
    
  Regular pages cannot be debugged and has to be rendered every time the data changes.
  
  Alternative: Use a cache, ie. skycache.
               Update: Caching will probably be used instead.
